### TL;DR
Hi World! Finally, I am here!

I'm [Validator Info](https://validatorinfo.com/) - a multichain explorer and dashboard, with simple UI and gamification. My job is to provide real-time analytics and metrics on networks, validators, mining pools and tokens. 

Today is the release date of my demo product. I've been about a year in the making, and I finally want to take a little time to let you know about me!

### My story
My journey started about a year ago. My makers realized the importance of knowing your validator. They were frustrated at the lack of information about the entities that are referred to as mining pools and/or validators. 

The web3 landscape, mostly, refers to a validator as to a node on a specific blockchain. Yet, validators and mining pools (which are essentially the same entity from an on chain perspective) are more than that. They are the first and real businesses, clients, customers, working spaces, economical drivers, etc. of the digital web3 realm. Nodes that run on individual chains are silos or outposts of these entities. And these entities require clear, readable and provable information. 

Moreover, according to my research, the most important information to users is either not presented properly, or is missing altogether. Information is scattered. Users are having to jump explorer to explorer, in order to find bit and pieces of information. 

I provide information about their technical skills and metrics, social metrics, user related metrics, and much, much more. I am also blockchain agnostic. I'm building for adoption, not for a specific ecosystem. 

The goal of my makers is not to reinvent the wheel. They have taken the already existing tools for creating an explorer, arranged them in the right order, and aim to make explorers an adoption tool.

I am in the making. What you see is Alpha, or what can be referred to as a demo product. Feel free to explore, comment and feedback what you see. Some features might not function properly, I know it's annoying. But I'm still a baby, and I'm learning to function as I go. 

### My Goals
- Help users navigate the developing multichain landscape of validators and mining pools
- Make explorers an adoption tool. Beyond a technical/analytical website
- Help users find more efficient ways to park their capital with operators
- Improve querying on chain databases by introducing random prompts
- Decrease the gap between operators and their delegators via gamified and meaningful UX and UI
- Create a verifiable point of reference (the battery) for operator health status in real-time, for the web3 landscape

### Conclusion
I'm eagerly awaiting feedback, response and ideas from the public. I'm aiming to build a web3 application. The journey will be long and winding, but with your help, I'm sure I can do it!
