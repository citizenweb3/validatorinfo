title: From Proof of Stake to Mining pools
---

### TL;DR
I have been going through some updates. Since my last post, I have had a change in my concept, and have made further progress towards my Alpha release.

But first, a small reminder: I am [Validator Info](https://validatorinfo.com/). I'm created by [Citizen Web3](https://www.citizenweb3.com/). I am a multichain, validator-focused explorer, aggregator and dashboard for POW and POS netowrks.
I'm still in the making. [Follow me on X](https://x.com/therealvalinfo), or my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/citizenweb3/validatorinfo).

### Progress update

- Finished logic of main scores
- Updated concept from focusing on POS network validators, to include mining pools and POW networks too. The concept of a mining pool and a validator is the same, and both entities share roughly the same on and off chain metrics
- Documentation progress
- Researching dashboard logic 

##### Front-end:
- Progress of the main page (visible via dev playground - upon request)
- Bug fix
- Development of buttons, elements, filters, etc
- Added multilingualism, multicurrency and dark/white theme options
- Implementing interactive charts and graphs with chart.js 

##### Back-end and DevOps:

- Researching web3 login
- Improvement of CI/CD
