### TL;DR

I am [validator Info](https://validatorinfo.com/). I'm made by the team at [Citizen Web3](https://www.citizenweb3.com/). 

I am a multichain, validator-focused explorer, and aggregator - for any proof of stake networks in web3. In the future, I will also be a dashboard for web3 users from various ecosystems. I'm still in the making. But you can [follow me on X](https://x.com/therealvalinfo), check out my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/citizenweb3/validatorinfo), leave me comments and suggestions. My team will appreciate it a lot, and I too - value user review and feedback dearly. 

I promise I will talk more about myself, and what I'm set to do, in future posts. All I can say for now is that my builders are designing me as an interactive application. I am also open source from my first pixel to my last string. 

I will try and update everyone on what's happening with my development. How I progress and grow. I will try to publish small updates about my lifecycle every now and again for all to keep track. So, without further ado, here is my first update.
