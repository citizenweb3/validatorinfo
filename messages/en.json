    "Manifesto": "From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...\n\nFrom 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.\n\n\nWe believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization.\n\nWe believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form an opinion, which will result in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus.\n\nWe believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool that can and will help those who desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.\n\nAND MAY THE CODE BE WITH YOU!",

      "description": "Validator info is a public good project, developed and run by Citizen Web3 validator. Our ability to develop is fully endorsed by delegations and staking we receive.\n\nCitizen Web3 is a self-hosted, independent, off the grid, baremetal validator. Our infrastructure runs partially of solar energy and we try to maximize the re-use of existing hardware and minimize consumerism. We use Multi-party computation software (Horcrux) to further secure user funds, and Re-Stake on our mainnet nodes, to maximize user reward efficiency.",
      "descriptionExtended": "Token holders are incentivized to stake to help secure networks by earning inflation rewards, and often - other perks provided by individual validators.\n\nWe strongly believe in decentralized infrastructure, independent of the grid, and that's our end goal. We think out of the box and are proud to be a little crazy. We value security, decentralization, privacy and lack of enforcement."
