I’m created by the team at <citizenLink>Citizen Web3</citizenLink>. \n\nI am a multichain, validator-focused explorer and aggregator - for various networks, living in web3. I am able to read and understand both: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake chains. This means I will show information about validators, mining pools and the networks themselves. \n\nMy goal is to help web3 users to discover more information about validators and mining pools, that are securing their favorite networks, or - use my explorer to find the most relevant information you need. \n\nI’m still in the making. You can <xLink>follow me on X</xLink>, check out one of my <ghLink>GitHub repos</ghLink>, leave me comments and suggestions. \n\nCitizen Web3, as a project started in 2020, finding roots in ancap vibes, personal values of building a better society, ecosystem development and networking.

    "Manifesto": "From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...\n\nFrom 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.\n\n\nWe believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization.\n\nWe believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form an opinion, which will result in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus.\n\nWe believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool that can and will help those who desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.\n\nAND MAY THE CODE BE WITH YOU!",

CW3 monetizes via staking.\n\nCW3 helps to secure blockchain networks by providing infrastructure. This includes validator, testnet, and various public nodes.\n\nCitizen Web3 is a self-hosted, independent off the grid, baremetal validator. We use a mixture of cloud and self-hosted infrastructure, which works on a mixture of broadband and Starlink internet connections, and partially runs off solar energy. We strongly believe in decentralized infrastructure, independent of the grid, and that's our end goal.\n\nWe use Multi-party computation software (<horcrux>Horcrux</horcrux>) on all our nodes, to further secure funds, and protect our stakers from double signing. We use <restake>Re-Stake</restake> on our mainnet nodes, set to restake twice per day, so users can compound their staking rewards more efficiently.\n\nToken holders of networks we validate, can stake with us to help secure these networks and to support our activities. Their incentive for doing so, is earning staking rewards, and other, <planned>planned</planned>, incentives in the future. We are devoted to our <mission>mission</mission>, we think out of the box, and are proud to be a little crazy. We value security, decentralization, privacy and lack of enforcement."
